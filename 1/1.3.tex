\section*{Exercise 1.3}

\subsection*{Problem}

Consider the following factor 2 approximation algorithm for the cardinality vertex cover
problem. Find a depth first search tree in the given graph, $G = (V, E)$, and output the 
set, say $S$, of all the nonleaf vertices of this tree. Show that $S$ is indeed a vertex
cover for $G$ and $|S| \leq 2 |\opt|$. \\

\textbf{Vertex Cover.} A vertex cover of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a set of vertices $S$
such that each edge $e \in E$ is incident to at least one vertex $v \in S$. \\

\textbf{Cardinality Vertex Cover Problem.} Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, compute the 
minimum cardinality vertex cover.

\subsection*{Solution}

\begin{lemma*}
    In the depth first search tree of $G = (V, E)$, there are no edges between leaf 
    nodes.
\end{lemma*}

\begin{proof}
    Let $L$ be the set of leaf vertices in the depth first search tree. For the sake of
    contradiction, suppose not, suppose there exist some edge $\{u, v\} \in E$ such that
    $u, v \in L$. Either $u$ or $v$ was explored first in the depth first search tree.
    Without loss of generality, assume $u$ was explored first. Then $v$ must be a child
    of $u$ in the depth first search tree since it is unexplored and reachable from $u$. 
    Thus $u$ is not a leaf, which is a contradiction. There must be no edges between 
    leaf nodes in the depth first search tree.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma*}
    The set of nonleaf vertices $S$ in the depth first search tree of $G = (V, E)$ is a 
    vertex cover of $G$.
\end{lemma*}

\begin{proof}
    Any edge $e \in E$ with a nonleaf endpoint is covered by $S$. Then, the only 
    possible uncovered edges have two leaf endpoints. However, by the lemma, there are
    no such edges. Hence $S$ is a vertex cover. 
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem*}
    The set of nonleaf vertices $S$ in the depth first search tree of $G = (V, E)$ is a 
    factor 2 approximation for the minimum cardinality vertex cover of $G$.
\end{theorem*}

\begin{proof}
    We will show that there is maximal matching of size $|S|$. Construct a matching $M$
    as follows. Starting with the root of the tree $r$, add $(r, u)$ to $M$ where $u$ is
    the first child of $r$. Then recurse on the children of $u$ and the children of $r$
    except $u$. Only recurse on nodes in $S$. This matching is incident to every vertex
    in $S$. Moreover, by the lemma, this matching is maximal, since there are no edges
    between vertices outside of $S$ and these are the only unmatched vertices. \\

    By the approximate min-max relation between minimum maximal matching and cardinality
    vertex cover, $|S|$ is a 2 approximation.
\end{proof}
